# Snapshot Subgraph migration 

This quest is to migrate the [Snapshot Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/snapshot-labs/snapshot) to Squid SDK. The resulting squid should match the GraphQL API of the subgraph as close as possible, by migrating `schema.graphql`. The judges reserve the right to request improvements afther the initial review of the submission. Reach out to the [Discord Channel]( https://discord.com/channels/857105545135390731/1155812879770058783) for any tech questions regarding this quest.

# Acceptance critera

Each quest should be submitted as a private repo and will be reviewed manually. To submit, create an issue with url to your repo and invite the following github accounts: [@dariaag](https://github.com/dariaag), [@belopash](https://github.com/belopash), [@abernatskiy](https://github.com/abernatskiy) and [@dzhelezov](https://github.com/dzhelezov). The repo should contain `README.MD` with

- Insturctions how to run the squid locally
- Sample Squid queries and the corresponding Subgraph queries

The code should be well documented. The judges will access:

- In-line commends where necessary
- Clarity of the code
- Performance and optimization (if [batching](https://docs.subsquid.io/basics/batch-processing/)  and [Multicall queries](https://docs.subsquid.io/tutorials/bayc/step-four-optimizations/#using-multicall-for-aggregating-state-queries) are used whenever appropriate)
